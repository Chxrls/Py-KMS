1) Global Variable

2) Static Variable  -->

## Global Variable
Global variables are the variables that are defined outside the function and can be accessed inside the function.

````python
a = 10
def func():
    print(a)
func()
````
Output:
````python
10
````

- Using global keyboard
````python
a = 10
def func():
    global a
    a = 20
    print(a)
func()
print(a)
````

Output:
````python
20
20
````

## Static Variable
Static variables are the variables that are defined inside the function and can be accessed inside the function.

````python
def func():
    a = 10
    print(a)
func()
````

Output:
````python
10
````

- Using nonlocal keyword
````python
def func():
    a = 10
    def func1():
        nonlocal a
        a = 20
        print(a)
    func1()
    print(a)
func()

````

Output:
````python
20
20
````
